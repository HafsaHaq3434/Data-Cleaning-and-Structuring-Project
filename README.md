# Data Cleaning and Structuring Project
Led a comprehensive initiative involving the cleaning and structuring of data from 100 raw files. Leveraged Python's os and re libraries to meticulously extract crucial information such as Names, ID details, Application Requirements, and Funding Intended. Systematically organized the extracted data into well-defined columns. Implemented an efficient process to save the cleaned data by generating a CSV file, ensuring optimal accessibility and usability for subsequent analyses. This project underscores my proficiency in data manipulation, extraction, and organization, showcasing a meticulous approach to handling large datasets.
